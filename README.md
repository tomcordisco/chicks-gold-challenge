# ChicksGoldChallenge

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 17.3.8.

## Description
This is a mock front-end application developed as part of a technical challenge.

## Instalations

First, you need to install Angular CLI:

Run `npm install -g @angular/cli@17`

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Design Decisions

Framework: I chose Angular for its robustness and capability to handle large and complex applications.
Pure CSS: I used pure CSS to demonstrate my skills in design and styling without relying on frameworks.
Placeholder Images: I used images from my favorite games to personalize the design and add a personal touch.
